# Multiple Device QR Authentication

## Introduction
This project is a simple demonstration of how to implement multiple device QR authentication using ASP.NET Core 7. It showcases the integration of RESTful API and Websockets to create a secure and efficient authentication system.

## Features
- **QR Code Generation token:** Users can generate QR codes token to build QR images on their client for authentication.
- **RESTful API:** The project provides a RESTful API for device registration and QR code validation.
- **Websockets:** Real-time communication is established through Websockets for seamless authentication.
- **Security:** Security measures are implemented to ensure the authenticity of the devices.
