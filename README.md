# Multiple Device QR Authentication

## Introduction
This project is a simple demonstration of how to implement multiple device QR authentication using ASP.NET Core 7. It showcases the integration of RESTful API and Websockets to create a secure and efficient authentication system.

## Features
- **QR Code Generation token:** Users can generate QR codes token to build QR images on their client for authentication.
- **RESTful API:** The project provides a RESTful API for device registration and QR code validation.
- **Websockets:** Real-time communication is established through Websockets for seamless authentication.
- **Security:** Security measures are implemented to ensure the authenticity of the devices.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [ASP.NET Core 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or your preferred code editor.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
Open the project in your code editor.

Configure your ASP.NET Core 7 environment and dependencies.

Run the application:


dotnet run
Visit http://localhost:5000 in your browser to access the authentication system.

Usage
Register your device on the system.
Generate a QR code for your device.
Scan the QR code from another device to authenticate.
Code Examples
Here are some code snippets that demonstrate key aspects of the project:

Generating a QR Code
// Code example for generating a QR code
public IActionResult GenerateQRCode()
{
    // Generate QR code logic here
    // ...
    return Ok(qrCode);
}
Authenticating via Websockets

Copy code
// Code example for handling Websockets authentication
public async Task AuthenticateWebSocketConnection()
{
    // WebSocket authentication logic here
    // ...
    await Clients.Caller.SendAsync("Authenticated", isAuthenticated);
}
